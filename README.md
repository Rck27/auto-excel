# auto-excel
tried to automate my intern's job

this thing would make new xslx file, or add into existing one
and give it a value of name, and phone num

pip install -r requirements.txt


usage :
python main.py
  just type the name, and followed by its num after a space
it should be like this:
>rick 08132123123 someone 3129812938 and so on
